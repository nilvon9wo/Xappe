Salesforce Apex framework solutions for Trigger Handlers and SObject Selectors.

A new trigger handling framework with a minimalist, heavily OOP design.

The selector framework is heavily derivative of Apex Commons, but with the following modifications:
1. Clean code.
2. Concise classes and methods.
3. Minimalist dependencies, all explicitly injected whenever possible.
4. An OOP approach to generating the SOQL WHERE clause.
